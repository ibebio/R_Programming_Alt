  Output: You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)
  CorrectAnswer: my_div
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_div')
  Hint: If your programming environment doesn't support auto-completion, just type my_div and hit Enter to move on.
